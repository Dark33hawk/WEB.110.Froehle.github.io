border-radius allows for curved borders on outlines. use % to change based on window size
it only has one color? can you use gradiant or shading, perhaps more tha one color?
i should honestly just draw it all and write it on paper first
instead of one color, use linear-gradient to allow color change from top to bottom
you can add as many colors as you want with , 
45deg, is used for changing orientation from top to bottom 
background color: linear-gradient(crimson, orange);
can change gradient to radial instead of linear to allow for shapes instead.
background color: radial-gradient(circle, crimson, orange);
circle or closest side, elipse
alpha-gradient allows for more color blending? look into it
