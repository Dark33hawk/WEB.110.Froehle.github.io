<!-- page design notes god this room is hot
we were learning about external style sheets. we are not learning about design
now onto devisions, like header and footer and body of a docuument
divisions
they can be changed depending. 
putting a class after the div allows for division being changed without the rest of the page, via external style sheet. figure this out!!!!
padding can be changed via external style sheet, is defined by pixels and allows for creating distance. padding has the same distance for all sides, but can be defined to only a side
padding-bottom: 50px;
no additional subparameters means the padding will be applied on all sides.
border
border will surround what ever you put it on, via external style sheet and class style.
border: solid 10px purple; 
borber will surround the padding
margin
margin is differen thtan padding 
padding,border,margin
class can set the height so divisions can be set, a footer to be made at the actual bottom of the page.
height will not change due to amount of words, overflow happens
responsiveness
you dont knkow how big their screen is, causing overflow on some computers, responsiveness is flexability
min-height will scale to content addition, in absence the division will revert to min-height
width can be applied here, forcing text to wrap in absolute width and scale with min-width.
header,nav,article,section,aside,footer
look into css style shit ASAP
float will push division relative to others, but still in code line.
take division into other divisions to form subdivisions, article and section, to exist within float and padding and margin
changes within subdivions will not affect outer division
divisoins will shift to the next available spot, top line gets priority
can set height and width to percents so it scales
