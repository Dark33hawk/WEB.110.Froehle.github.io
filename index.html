<div class="articleone"> <p>Why do I like Magic: the Gathering?</p> 
    <p class="sectionone"> I like this game because it is complex with a rich history of original fantasy stories.
        Players in a game of Magic represent powerful, dueling wizards called Planeswalkers. 
        Each card a player draws from their deck 
        represents a magical spell which can be used to their advantage in battle. 
        Instant and Sorcery cards represent magical spells 
        a player may cast for a one-time effect,
        while Creature, Artifact, and Enchantment 
        cards remain on the Battlefield to provide long-term advantage. 
        Additionally, players must include resource, or Land cards representing
        the amount of magic that is available to cast their spells.
        Typically, a player defeats their opponent(s) by reducing their life
        totals to zero, which is commonly done via combat damage, or 
        attacking with creatures. 
        Many other sources of damage exist in the game, 
        however, in addition to alternative win-conditions which do not check life totals.

<h3 class="articletwo"> Why do I like Star Trek?
    <p class="sectiontwo">I like Star Trek for their continued message of hope and optimisim.
        So many things are cynical, apathetic or downright malicisous. 
        Having a show that enourages scientific growth, spiritual understanding and empathy is a gust of fresh air.
        Star Trek is an American science fiction media franchise created by Gene Roddenberry, 
        which began with the eponymous 1960s television series and became a worldwide pop-culture
         phenomenon. Since its creation, the franchise has expanded into various films, television
          series, video games, novels, and comic books, and it has become one of the most recognizable
           and highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

    <p class="asidetwo">My favorite show within star trek is Deep Space Nine.
        Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, frequently abbreviated as DS9, takes place during the
         last years of and immediately after the show Star Trek: The next Generation 
         It debuted the week of January 3, 1993, and ran for seven seasons. 
         Unlike the other Star Trek series, Deep Space Nine was set primarily on a 
         space station of the same name rather than aboard a starship.
         Deep Space Nine stands apart from earlier Trek series for its lengthy serialized
          storytelling, character conflicts, and religious themesâ€”all elements praised by 
          critics and audiences, but which Roddenberry had forbidden as a producer of the
           original series and the Next Generation.
